Slide Navigation
================

This is an attempt to make a Facebook-like navigation panel for Sencha Touch 2.
To see a current working demo, visit http://wnielson.github.com/sencha-SlideNavigation/
on a mobile device (only iOS and Safari have been tested).  To see the
navigation menu in the example, "flick" the toolbar (at the top) to the right;
the opposite action can be used to close the menu.

This is a work in progress and still needs work.

Getting Started
---------------

Using the SlideNavigation view in your project is now easier than before.
Simply add the following at the beginning of your app:

    Ext.Loader.setConfig({enabled:true});
    Ext.Loader.setPath('SlideNavigation', 'lib/slide');

Adjust the string "lib/slide" to wherever you have placed the "slide" folder.
Then in whatever component you wish to use the view, add:

    requires = [
        'SlideNavigation.View',
    ]

For a more complete example, see "app.js".

To compile the code, do:
    
    sencha build -p app.jsb3 -d ./
